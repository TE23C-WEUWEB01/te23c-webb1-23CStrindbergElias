        <p>Martin David Robinson (September 26, 1925 to December 8, 1982), known professionally as Marty Robbins, was an
            American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and NASCAR racing driver. Robbins was one of the most
            popular and successful country and western singers for most of his nearly four-decade career, which spanned
            from the late 1940s to the early 1980s. He was also an early outlaw country pioneer.</p>
        <p>Born in Glendale, Arizona, Robbins taught himself guitar while serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II,
            and subsequently drew fame performing in clubs in and around his hometown. In 1952, he released his first
            No. 1 country song, "I'll Go On Alone". Four years later, he released his second No.1 hit "Singing the
            Blues", and one year later, released two more No. 1 hits, "A White Sport Coat" and "The Story of My Life".
            In 1959, Robbins released his signature song, "El Paso", for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Country
            & Western Recording. The song began Robbins' association with western balladry, a style which would become a
            staple of his career. Later releases that drew critical acclaim include "Don't Worry", "Big Iron", "Devil
            Woman" and "Honkytonk Man", the last for which the 1982 Clint Eastwood film is named, and in which Robbins
            made his final appearance before his death.</p>
